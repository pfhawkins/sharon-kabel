Most of my content is fairly dense, so today I decided to take a break and have fun with some lighter content. The National Association of Pastoral Musicians (NPM) has made freely available most of the issues of their magazine _Pastoral Music_:

To get a sense of what musicians, liturgists, cantors, academics, priests, and others were talking about in the years following the Second Vatican Council, I collected some excerpts from the first five volumes, from 1976-1981. The photos currently live in a Facebook album, at the link below. Enjoy!
