The Kyriale contains all of the chants for the Ordinary of the Mass. 

While there is some debate about the historical origins and uses of the Mass and Credo settings, popular custom and tradition have given us several Mass and Credo pairings based on the season or feast. 

| Season                | Mass setting   | Creed setting |
| ------------------    | -------------- | ------------- |
| `Advent`              | XVII           | IV   |
| `Christmas`           | IX             | IV   | 
| `Time after Epiphany` | XI             | I    |
| `Lent`                | XVII           | IV   |
| `Easter`              | I              | III  |
| `Time after Pentecost`| XI             | I    |
| `Feasts of Mary`      | IX, X          | IV   | 
| `Feasts of Apostles`  | IV             | III  |
| `Weddings`            | any            | none |
| `Funerals`            | pro defunctis  | none |
