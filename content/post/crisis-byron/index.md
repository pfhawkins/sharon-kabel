This is an article series dedicated to cataloging minor vignettes within the modern crisis of the Catholic Church. 

By "modern crisis," I mean the serious of reforms and attempted reforms of the liturgy, theology, and customs that snowballed from the 1800s until the 1980s. 

While it is alluring to make the Second Vatican Council the scapegoat for the many crises, it is increasingly clear that the roots of what the Council rubberstamped were in place long before the Council. 

IT is similarly tempting to make prominent figures like Father Annibale Bugnini the focus of one's ire or fascination. This series, instead, will look at "B-list" reformers and movements and terms, and attempt to connect small dots in the grand picture.
