Holy Week went through extensive reforms in 1955. These have been documented just as extensively. This project takes the reverse tactic: documenting the reasons for elements, vestments, colors, readings, etc. in pre-1955 Holy Weeks. 

The core of the project is a spreadsheet, and I add to it continually. A more readable image series is available on Facebook.
