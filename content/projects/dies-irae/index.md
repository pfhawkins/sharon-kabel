The Dies Irae is considered by many to be not only the greatest sequence, but the greatest Latin poem in history. There are hundreds of translations and commentaries on the chant.

One of the best commentaries is the book, _Dies Irae_, by Fr. Nicholas Gihr.

I made a photo series that, for each image, combines one stanza of the _Dies Irae_ with one quote from Fr. Gihrâ€™s book that illuminates that particular stanza.
