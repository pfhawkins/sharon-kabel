Holy Week went through extensive reforms in 1955. These have been documented just as extensively. This project takes the reverse tactic: documenting the reasons for vestments, colors, readings, etc. in the pre-1955 Holy Week. Why was Palm Sunday's vestment color purple, not red? When do you have the ceremony of washing the feet? What's the Mass of the Presanctified?

The core of the project is a spreadsheet, which I add to regularly. A more readable image series is available on Facebook.
