According to [BishopAccountability](bishopaccountability.org), 149 American Roman Catholic dioceses have released lists of clergy credibly accused of sexual abuse of a minor. 

This project looks at the lists themselves. Every list, of course, has names of the accused on them. In the bishops' repeatedly stated goal of transparency, what other information do they include in the lists? 

I looked for three things: 
1) A complete parish assignment history (parish assignments, including dates)
2) photographs of the accused
3) details of the allegations (such as dates of occurrence, dates reported, number of allegations, gender of victims, and/or nature of the allegations)

The project is ongoing. You can see the project in several places:
