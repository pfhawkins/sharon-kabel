# Citation sources in papal documents

Citations extracted from http://w2.vatican.va/content/vatican/en.html and http://www.papalencyclicals.net/. All data are in Excel. Contact me if you’d like a copy or if you’ve spotted an error!

These charts do not include Scriptural citations. All popes quoted Scripture in their documents; what is not consistent is how they handled those quotes. Some popes provided a citation at the end, and some simply included an in-text citation. As a result, comparing the exact citations will make it look as though certain popes or documents did not use any Scripture. To improve usefulness – that is, to more easily compare citations among papal documents – I have removed Scriptural citations from the final count. 

# Word counts in papal documents

Word counts include the text of the papal encyclical, and any citations at the end of the document. All data are in Excel. Contact me if you’d like to know more, or you see a mistake!

Each graph tells a very different story, so they should be considered contextually. Pope John XXIII, for example, has the lowest number of total paragraphs, but the second highest average number of paragraphs.

The longer the reign, the more words they wrote – but contrasting the _total_ numbers with _average_ numbers can reveal surprises. Pope Leo XIII, to take another example, has the lowest average paragraph and average word counts, but one of the highest total paragraph and total word counts.
