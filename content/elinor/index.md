This project is a makeshift family archive. I am preserving some fragile and/or significant family records, as well as documenting how I'm preserving them. 

The project is ongoing, and will be updated regularly. 

# Elinor Bolger (nee Parks) 

Elinor Bolger is my paternal grandmother. I first started collecting records about her when I discovered that her alma mater, St. Joseph's College in Brooklyn, NY, had digitized and made freely available all of their students yearbooks, literary magazines, and alumnae newsletters. 

A few years ago, I discovered a photograph album of hers in our garage. The paper is extremely fragile, so I am in the process of scanning both the pages (which have valuable and informative captions), and the photos. As I preserve this album, I will gradually add supplemental information on the people, places, and allusions in her photos and captions. 

She called her album, _Studies in Art (after Rembrandt, Whistler, Turner, Miller, etc.)_, so that's the title I will use for the album.
