summary: Although it is now frequently claimed that the traditional Latin Mass (TLM)
  was never abrogated (totally abolished) following the Second Vatican Council, this
  position is squarely at odds not only with the lived experience of several generations
  of Catholics, but with the rapid and near total disappearance of the TLM within
  a brief period of time.
