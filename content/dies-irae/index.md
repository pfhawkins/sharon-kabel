The Dies Irae is considered by many to be not only the greatest [sequence](https://www.fisheaters.com/diesirae.html), but the greatest Latin poem in history. There are hundreds of translations and commentaries on the chant.

One of the best commentaries is the book, _Dies Irae_, by Fr. Nicholas Gihr.

I made a photo series that, for each image, combines one stanza of the _Dies Irae_ with one quote from Fr. Gihrâ€™s book that illuminates that particular stanza.
