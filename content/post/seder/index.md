This is the first post in an ongoing series, documenting assorted topics as they appear in Catholic Newspapers in the [Catholic News Archive](https://thecatholicnewsarchive.org/). How was the topic described? When did it peak in usage? Did its connotations or associations for Catholics change over time?  

## Methods: Search terms 

"seder meal"
"seder meal"~10
passover meal
"Catholic seder"~20

## Results

The most useful search was "seder meal"~10. Almost all of the early (1880s-1950s) results for "seder" were false hits - a result of the OCR. "Seder" picked up, for example, "order" and "under" 

I could not find any relevant results about Catholic celebration of or participation in seder meals before the early 1960s. The earliest relevant example is a curious one, from 1951[1].

> KOREAN DISPATCH DESCRIBING DINNER BY RABBI AS INTER-FAITH SERVICE IN ERROR, PRIEST SAYS
> Taegu, Korea, (Mall)—Catholic, Protestant and Jewish chaplains here say that a New York Times dispatch describing a Jewish Passover celebration here as "interfaith" and "inter-religious" was based on a misunderstanding. The Jewish chaplain who had charge of the Seder here, Capt. Oscar Lifshutz, said that when Inviting the Catholic and Protestant chaplains and other Gentiles, *he regarded the meal as a social gathering to commemorate the liberation of the Jewish people from bondage, not as a purely religious ceremony*. When the Dayenu Litany was sung, the other chaplains were present out of courtesy, not as participants. "Frankly," said Chaplain Lifshutz, "I am the Jewish chaplain here and I would not allow any non-Jewish minister to share my functions. The meal was held in a field hospital. Father Zielinski, the hospital chaplain, came to extend greetings," said Chaplain Lifshutz. "In his talk he said that 'we pray in different pews,'" The newspaper dispatch said that "the credo of the ancient Jewish festival was given by a Catholic padre in a prayer to God to free all people from tyranny." "I did not recite any form of prayer," declared the Rev. (Capt.) Aloysius Zielinski, priest of the Chicago archdiocese, "I said a few words stressing what all God-loving people have in common and also that we have, at the same time, different basic beliefs. 'We cannot meet in the same pew,' I said, 'but we can meet on our knees and pray that others may enjoy the freedom we enjoy.' The writer omitted what I said about our differences In belief and about our not meeting In the same pew." The dispatch said that the Jewish chaplain, wearing his white prayer shawl, "led the service, flanked on the left by a Catholic priest and on the right by a Protestant chaplain," "Chaplain Lifshutz assured me twice, before I accepted his Invitation, that the meal was not a religious service,” commented Father Zielinski. "He explained the prayer shawl as the sign that he is a Jewish chaplain. "It Is quite ambiguous to say that he was flanked by a Catholic chaplain and a Protestant. We were simply seated at the same table with him and we were not beside him. The dispatch failed to mention that two laypersons from the hospital staff, one a Colonel, the other a Lt.-Colonel, were also seated at the table and each beside the Jewish chaplain. The seating was according to army rank and not for any purpose of officiating jointly In a ritual.
