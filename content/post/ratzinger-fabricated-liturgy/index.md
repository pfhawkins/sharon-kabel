The following quotation is attributed to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI: 

> The liturgical reform, in its concrete realization, has distanced itself even more from its origin. The result has not been a reanimation, but devastation. In place of the liturgy, fruit of a continual development, they have placed a fabricated liturgy. They have deserted a vital process of growth and becoming in order to substitute a fabrication. They did not want to continue the development, the organic maturing of something living through the centuries, and they replaced it, in the manner of technical production, by a fabrication, a banal product of the moment. 

# Says who?

Many online sources cite this quotation to Ratzinger. The first 'mainstream' source is Dr. Taylor Marshall's website[^1], but by no means was he the first. The quotation has also appeared: 

* In 2013, on Latin Mass Society Chairman[^3]
* In 2009, on Summorum Pontificum's blog[^5]
* In 2008, on Fish Eaters[^4]

if any further attribution is given, it is always exactly the same. 

The identically-repeated attribution is: 

**_Revue Theologisches_, Vol. 20, Feb. 1990, pgs. 103-104**

I tend to view this exacting consistency as a red flag, as humans are inconsistent over time. A quote from _Pride and Prejudice_ may be attributed to the author only, or the character, or author and book title, or author and book title and publication year, and so on.

# A strange echo (the Gamber Version) 

Those familiar with the quotation under review have possibly noticed that it bears a strong resemblance to another Ratzinger quotation: 

> What happened after the Council was something else entirely: in the place of liturgy as the fruit of development came fabricated liturgy. We abandoned the organic, living process of growth and development over centuries, and replaced it – as in a manufacturing process – with a fabrication, a banal on-the-spot product.

This quotation is also decently widely cited. It is discussed at length at Patheos,[^10] and is attributed to Ratzinger's foreword in the book _La Reforme Liturgique en Question_ by Monsignor Klaus Gamber. 

For now, we'll set aside this latter quotation (the Gamber Version) and focus on finding the former _Theologische_ Version.

# Finding the journal 

It is rare that I have this much bibliographic information, down to the page number, so I initially assumed this quest would involve only a quick interlibrary loan request. 

I ran into immediate problems. My husband speaks German, and had cast an eyebrow at the spelling and syntax of the journal title. SUre enough, I couldn't find any journal called _Revue Theologisches_, but I did find a similarly titled journal: _Theologische Revue_. Such a major mistake this early on is a bit concerning. 

"Volume 20" was published in 1921, not 1990. Volume 86 would be the correct volume for 1990.[^15] 

"February" helps me, but only if I have the correct journal - which I may not, as I'm already working with significant typos.

I have page numbers, but who knows if they're correct given that the volume number is wrong? 

I didn't have an article title. 

I wasn't sure if I had an articke author - it's unclear if Ratzinger wrote or was simply quoted in the _Theologische Revue_.

I was not too confident about my interlibrary loan request, but I took the plunge and requested volume 86, pp. 103-104. Neither page, nor several surrounding pages, made any reference at all to Ratzinger, Gamber, or the liturgical reform. What the pages did tell me is that the journal, as its title suggests, focuses on book reviews.

The journal isn't available online for free, but it is indexed in Google Books[^14]. On a hunch that maybe there was a review of Gamber's book that maybe quoted Ratzinger, I searched for Gamber's and Ratzinger's names in volumes 86 and 87. I submitted additional requests for those pages, all of which turned out to be irrelevant. 

Because so many pieces of the citation were wrong or suspect, I had no way of knowing if I was going in the right direction. This seemingly robust and assuring citation was a total dead end. Short of reading the entire run of _Theologische Revue_, I had to rule it out and start from scratch. 

# Father Patrick de la Rocque

In my online travels, I had encountered the _Theologische_ Version of the quotation in one other place: a 2002 article in the Angelus Online by Father Patrick de la Rocque, SSPX.[^11] 

(Fr. de la Rocque's biography can be found here[^12]. In a case study in 'nothing is ever Trad Enough, the good padre incurred the wrath of Traditio in 2006.[^13])

In any case, Fr. de la Rocque's article, as Angelus tells us, was "Translated from Nouvelles de Chrétienté, No. 71, Jan. 2002." This article is the earliest example I can find online of the _Theologische_ Version and the erroneous _Revue Theologisches_ attribution. 

The _Nouvelles de Chretiente_ appears to be a long-running newsletter of the SSPX. I contacted the SSPX's website to see if I could request a copy of the article, but unfortunately never heard back. I've been unable to track down this 2002 _Nouvelle de Chretiente_ article. Nevertheless, it gave me an important clue. 

# A trip to Fontgombault Abbey

Fr. de la Rocque's article was a discussion on some recent events; namely, a conference on the liturgy at Fontgombault Abbey, July 22-24, 2001. Cardinal Ratzinger was one of the speakers, and his remarks appeared in conference proceedings (published in 2002[^16] and translated into English in 2003[^17]). It is unclear if Fr. de la Rocque attended the conference himself, but he definitely read the proceedings. 

It is clear that de la Rocque and Ratzinger were aware of each other; in Ratzinger's speech, he alludes to a book published by the SSPX in which de la Rocque played a major role. Some articles I skimmed online suggested that Ratzinger and de la Rocque had been in communication during one of the many chapters between Rome and the SSPX. 

At this point, I had no clues as to where my _Theologische_ Version quotation might be. I'd requested the 1990 and 1991 journal issues, which yielded nothing. I'd requested Fr. de la Rocque's 2002 French article for the SSPX, which did not get a response. So, I requested Ratzinger's speech from this 2001 conference. While a thought-provoking speech, it did not have my quotation, Gamber or _Theologische_ Editions. 

# Gamber 

I was nearly out of leads, but I wanted to check everything I could since this had been such an odd quest. I requested a copy of Ratzinger's Gamber foreword, in the original French. Call me untrusting. I received the foreword, and did indeed find the Gamber quotation in its French glory. 

At this point, it would be instructive to set our quotations - the original French, the Gamber Edition, and the _Theologische_ Edition - side-by-side. 

I added green highlights to exact (or near-exact) matches, yellow to analogous matches, and red to major differences. 

It finally dawned on me how remarkably similar these two English quotations were. In the now-verified Gamber Edition, Ratzinger is discussing the liturgical reform, and continually says "we." In the currently unverified _Theologische_ Edition, Ratzinger says Vatican II and "they." Besides that, the quotations are clearly nearly identical.

After considering all of these threads, I had an hypothesis. 

# A timeline and a proposed explanation

Here is what we know for sure:

* 1983: MOnsignor Klaus Gamber publishes _Die Reform der Romischen Liturgie_.
* 1992: _Die Reform_ is reprinted in French as _La Reforme Liturgique en Question_, with a foreword by Ratzinger. 
* 1993: _La Reforme_ is reprinted in English as _The Reform of the Roman Liturgy: Its Problems and Background_. The French and English editions contain the Gamber Version of the quotation given above, which begins, "What happened after the Council...".
* July 22-24, 2001: Fontgombault Abbey hosts a conference on the liturgy. Ratzinger speaks. 
* 2002: Conference proceedings are published in French. 
* 2002, January: Fr. Patrick de la Rocque of the SSPX writes an article for the SSPX newsletter about Ratzinger and the conference. Fr. de la Rocque gives the _Theologische_ Version of the quotation, citing as his source _Revue Theologisches_, Vol. 20, Feb. 1990, pgs. 103-104.
* 2002, later: Fr. de la Rocque's article is translated and republished in Angelus, thus debuting the _Revue Theologisches_ dubious citation into the English-speaking works.
* 2003: Conference proceedings are published in English.
* 2008: The _Theologische_ Version appears on Fish Eaters, and begins making the copy/pasted rounds in article comments on numerous Catholic websites. 
* 2013: Taylor Marshall uses it. 
* 2017: Aleteia uses it.
* 2019: Catholic World Report uses it.
* In 2015, Musica Sacra forums[^6]
* * In 2014, on Traditional Catholic Priest[^2]
* In 2017, on Aleteia[^7]
* In 2019, on Catholic World Report[^8] and One Peter Five[^9]

What I suggest is that in 2002 Fr. de la Rocque was quoting Ratzinger's Gamber foreword from memory, gave his own English translation (or the translator for the Angelus did), and added a completely wrong citation. 

This is not implausible, considering how similar the two versions of the quotations are, the foment and activity of the time, and the fact that we have seen misquotations from the French SSPX before.
