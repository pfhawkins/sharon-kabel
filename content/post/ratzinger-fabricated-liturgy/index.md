The following quotation is attributed to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI: 

> The liturgical reform, in its concrete realization, has distanced itself even more from its origin. The result has not been a reanimation, but devastation. In place of the liturgy, fruit of a continual development, they have placed a fabricated liturgy. They have deserted a vital process of growth and becoming in order to substitute a fabrication. They did not want to continue the development, the organic maturing of something living through the centuries, and they replaced it, in the manner of technical production, by a fabrication, a banal product of the moment. 

# Says who?

Many online sources cite this quotation to Ratzinger. The first 'mainstream' source is Dr. Taylor Marshall's website[^1], but by no means was he the first. 

* In 2014, Traditional Catholic Priest[^2]
* In 2013, Latin Mass Society Chairman[^3]
* In 2008, Fish Eaters[^4]
* In 2009, Summorum Pontificum's blog[^5]
* In 2015, Musica Sacra forums[^6]
* In 2017, Aleteia[^7]
* In 2019, Catholic World Report[^8] and One Peter Five[^9]

if any further attribution is given, it is always exactly the same. I tend to view this as a red flag, as humans are inconsistent over time. A quote from _Pride and Prejudice_ may be attributed to the author only, or the character, or author and book title, or author and book title and publication year, and so on.

The identically-repeated attribution is: 

_Revue Theologisches_, Vol. 20, Feb. 1990, pgs. 103-104

It is rare that I have this much information, down to the page number, so I initially assumed this quest would involve a quick interlibrary loan request. 

# Finding the journal 

As I should have suspected, I ran into immediate problems. My husband speaks German, and had cast an eyebrow at the spelling and syntax of the journal title. I couldn't find anything promising, but Worldcat did suggest another journal: _Theologische Revue_. 

I didn't have an article title. 

I wasn't sure if I had an author - it's unclear if Ratzinger wrote or was simply quoted in the _Theologische Revue_.

"Volume 20" was published in 1921, not 1990. Volume 86 would be the correct volume for 1990. 

"February" helps me, but only if I have the correct journal - which I may not, as I'm already working with significant typos.

I was not too confident about my interlibrary loan request, but I hoped that the page numbers would lead somewhere.

I requested volume 86, pp. 103-104. Neither page, nor several surrounding pages, made any reference at all to Ratzinger, Gamber, or the liturgical reform. What the pages did tell me is that the journal, as its title suggests, focuses on book reviews.

The journal isn't available online for free, but it is indexed in Google Books. On a hunch that maybe there was a review of Gamber's book that maybe quoted Ratzinger, I searched for Gamber's name in volumes 86 and 87. I submitted additional requests for pages with Gamber's name on them. All of those pages turned out to be irrelevant to my quest. 

In between all of these requests, I constantly double-checked my work. Because so many pieces of the citation were wrong or suspect, I had no way of knowing if I was going in the right direction. Short of reading the entire run of _Theologische Revue_, this seemingly robust and assuring citation was a total dead end. 

# A similar quotation 

Those familiar with the quotation under review have possibly noticed that it bears a strong resemblance to another Ratzinger quotation: 

# Timeline 

1983: Gamber publishes book in German
1991?: It is reprinted in French with a foreword by Ratzinger with the right-hand quote 
1991?: It is reprinted in English with the foreword
2001: Fontgombault Abbey hosts a conference on the liturgy. Ratzinger speaks. Conference proceedings are published by the monks in French. 
2002, January: Fr. Patrick de la Rocque of the SSPX writes an article for the SSPX newsletter about Ratzinger and the conference. I get the feeling the two men knew each other, as both were heavily involved in SSPX-Rome talks. Fr. de la Rocque gives the quote in question with the Revue Theologisches citation.
2003: The monks' conference proceedings are translated into English. 
2008: The quote in question with the Revue citation pops up on Fish Eaters, and begins making the rounds in article comments. 
2013: Taylor Marshall uses it 
2017: Aleteia uses it 
2019: Catholic World Report uses it

Running concurrently to this are discussions about the "banal quote" from Gamber's book

So we have two reasonable options here: 

A) Fr. de la Rocque goofed, and quoted Ratzinger from memory, and added a totally wrong citation. This is not uncommon for 90's-early aughts trads, or for the French SSPX. 

B ) Fr. goofed the details of the citation, but Ratzinger did say the Gamber quote, and perhaps Ratzinger re-articulated that quote at the monks' conference
