The following quotation is attributed to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI: 

> The liturgical reform, in its concrete realization, has distanced itself even more from its origin. The result has not been a reanimation, but devastation. In place of the liturgy, fruit of a continual development, they have placed a fabricated liturgy. They have deserted a vital process of growth and becoming in order to substitute a fabrication. They did not want to continue the development, the organic maturing of something living through the centuries, and they replaced it, in the manner of technical production, by a fabrication, a banal product of the moment. 

# Says who?

Many online sources attribute this to Ratzinger. The first 'mainstream' source is Dr. Taylor Marshall's website[^1] in 2013, but by no means was he the first. The quotation has also appeared: 

* In 2013, on Latin Mass Society Chairman[^2]
* In 2009, on The Gregorian Rite[^3]
* In 2008, on FishEaters forums[^4]

if any further attribution is given, it is always exactly the same:

**_Revue Theologisches_, Vol. 20, Feb. 1990, pgs. 103-104**

I tend to view this unerring consistency as a red flag. Humans are typically inconsistent with attribution. A quote from _Pride and Prejudice_ may be attributed to the author only, or the character, or author and book title, or author and book title and publication year, and so on. While the attribution may be perfectly legitimate, it could also be a sign of a poor game of Internet telephone, with endless copy-pasting without checking the original source.

# A familiar echo (the Gamber Version) 

Those familiar with the quotation under review have possibly noticed that it bears a strong resemblance to another Ratzinger quotation: 

> What happened after the Council was something else entirely: in the place of liturgy as the fruit of development came fabricated liturgy. We abandoned the organic, living process of growth and development over centuries, and replaced it – as in a manufacturing process – with a fabrication, a banal on-the-spot product.[^5]

This quotation is also decently widely cited. It is discussed at length at Patheos,[^6] and is attributed to Ratzinger's foreword in the book _The Reform of the Roman Liturgy_ by Monsignor Klaus Gamber. 

For now, we'll set this aside. 

For clarity's sake, I will refer to this quotation ("What happened after the Council...") as the **Gamber Version**. I'll refer to the quotation under review ("The liturgical reform...") as the **_Theologische_ Version**.

# Finding the journal 

It is rare that I have this much bibliographic information, down to the page number, so I initially hoped this quest would involve only a quick interlibrary loan request. 

I ran into immediate problems. My husband speaks German, and had already cast an eyebrow at the spelling and syntax of the journal title. Sure enough, I couldn't find any journal called _Revue Theologisches_. 

I did find a similarly titled journal: _Theologische Revue_. Such a major mistake this early on is a bit concerning. 

"Volume 20" was published in 1921, not 1990. Volume 86 would be the correct volume for 1990.[^7] 

I have page numbers and a month, but who knows if they're correct given that the volume number is wrong? 

I wasn't sure if I had an article author - it's unclear if Ratzinger wrote or was simply quoted in the _Theologische Revue_ - and I didn't have an article title. 

I was not too confident about my interlibrary loan request, but I took the plunge and requested volume 86, pp. 103-104. Neither page, nor several surrounding pages, made any reference at all to Ratzinger, Gamber, or the liturgical reform. What the pages did tell me is that the journal, as its title suggests, focuses on book reviews.

The journal isn't available online for free, but it is indexed in Google Books[^8]. On a hunch that maybe there was a review of Gamber's book that maybe quoted Ratzinger, I searched for Gamber's and Ratzinger's names in volumes 86 and 87. I submitted additional requests for those pages, all of which turned out to be irrelevant. 

This seemingly robust citation was a total dead end. Short of reading the entire run of _Theologische Revue_, I had to rule it out and start from scratch. 

# Father Patrick de la Rocque and the SSPX

In my online travels, I had encountered the _Theologische_ Version of the quotation in one other place: a 2002 article[^9] in the Angelus by Father Patrick de la Rocque, SSPX.

(Two profiles of Fr. de la Rocque can be found at Angelus[^10] and Traditio, the latter of which is a case study in 'nothing is ever Trad Enough.[^11])

In any case, Fr. de la Rocque's article, as Angelus tells us, was "Translated from _Nouvelles de Chrétienté_, No. 71, Jan. 2002." This article is the earliest example I can find online of the _Theologische_ Version, both the quotation and the erroneous _Revue Theologisches_ attribution. 

The _Nouvelles de Chrétienté_ is a newsletter of the SSPX. I contacted the SSPX's website to see if I could request a copy of the article, but unfortunately never heard back. I've been unable to track down this 2002 _Nouvelle de Chretiente_ article. Nevertheless, it gave me an important clue. 

# A trip to Fontgombault Abbey

Fr. de la Rocque's article was a discussion on some recent events; namely, a conference on the liturgy at Fontgombault Abbey, July 22-24, 2001. Cardinal Ratzinger, as prefect of the Congregation of the Doctrine of Faith, was one of the speakers. His remarks, "The Theology of the Liturgy," appeared in conference proceedings (published in 2002[^12] and translated into English in 2003[^13] by Margaret McHugh and Father John Parsons). It is unclear if Fr. de la Rocque attended the conference himself, but he definitely read the proceedings. 

Ratzinger's speech directly referenced a book published by the SSPX: 

> I mention this strange opposition between the Passover and sacrifice because it represents the architectonic principle of a book recently published by the Society of St Pius X, claiming that a dogmatic rupture exists between the new Liturgy of Paul VI and the preceding Catholic liturgical tradition.5 [/.../] [Footnote] 5. Cf. The Society of Saint Pius X, The Problem of the Liturgical Reform, Angelus Press, Kansas City 2001.[^13]

_The Problem of the Liturgical Reform_ was edited by de la Rocque[^14], so it is quite possible that de la Rocque and Ratzinger were aware of each other. 

At this point, I had no clues as to where my _Theologische_ Version quotation might be. I'd requested the 1990 and 1991 _Theologische Revue_ journal issues, which yielded nothing. I'd requested de la Rocque's 2002 French article reprinted in the Angelus, which did not get a response. Ratzinger's speech from the 2001 Fontgombault conference, while thought-provoking, did not have my quotation either.

# A return to Monsignor Gamber 

Because I was out of leads, I decided to check the similar-sounding quotation, the Gamber Version. I requested a copy of Ratzinger's Gamber foreword, in the original French. Call me untrusting. I received the foreword, and did indeed find the Gamber Version in its French glory: 

> Ce qui s'est passé après le Concile signifie tout autre chose: à la place de la liturgie fruit d'un développement continu, on a mis une liturgie fabriquée. On est sorti du processus vivant de croissance et de devenir pour entrer dans la fabrication. On n'a plus voulu continuer le devenir et la maturation organiques du vivant à travers les siècles, et on les a remplacés-à la manière de la production technique- par une fabrication, produit banal de l'instant.[^15]

At this point, it would be instructive to set our quotations - the original French, the Gamber Edition, and the _Theologische_ Edition - side-by-side. 

I added green highlights to exact (or near-exact) matches, and red to major differences.

It finally dawned on me how remarkably similar these two English quotations were. 

After considering all of these threads, I had an hypothesis. 

# A timeline and a proposed explanation

Here is what we know for sure:

* 1983: Monsignor Klaus Gamber publishes _Die Reform der Romischen Liturgie_.
* 1992: _Die Reform_ is reprinted in French as _La Reforme Liturgique en Question_, with a foreword by Ratzinger.[^15] 
* 1993: _La Reforme_ is reprinted in English as _The Reform of the Roman Liturgy: Its Problems and Background_.[^5] The French and English editions contain the Gamber Version of the quotation, which begins, "What happened after the Council...".
* July 22-24, 2001: Fontgombault Abbey hosts a conference on the liturgy. Ratzinger gives a talk called, "The Theology of the Liturgy." 
* 2002, January: Fr. Patrick de la Rocque of the SSPX writes an article for the SSPX newsletter about Ratzinger and the conference. Fr. de la Rocque gives the _Theologische_ Version of the quotation, citing as his source _Revue Theologisches_, Vol. 20, Feb. 1990, pgs. 103-104. Fr. de la Rocque's article is translated and republished in Angelus, thus debuting the dubious _Revue Theologisches_ attribution into the English-speaking world.
* 2002: Fontgombault conference proceedings are published in French.[^12] 
* 2003: Fontgombault conference proceedings are published in English.[^13]
* 2008: The _Theologische_ Version appears on FishEaters forums[^4], and begins making the copy/pasted rounds in article comments on numerous Catholic websites. 
* 2013: Taylor Marshall uses it.[^1]
* 2014: Traditional Catholic Priest uses it.[^16]
* 2017: Aleteia uses it.[^17]
* 2019: Catholic World Report[^18] and One Peter Five[^19] use it.

What I suggest is that in 2002 Fr. de la Rocque quoted Ratzinger's Gamber foreword from memory, in somewhat different wording. For reasons mysterious to me, he attributed the quotation to the non-existent _Revue Theologisches_ and a jumble of mismatched volume metadata.

# Did he say it? 

Well, yes and no. 

We know for sure that Ratzinger said the Gamber Version: 

> Ce qui s'est passé après le Concile signifie tout autre chose: à la place de la liturgie fruit d'un développement continu, on a mis une liturgie fabriquée. On est sorti du processus vivant de croissance et de devenir pour entrer dans la fabrication. On n'a plus voulu continuer le devenir et la maturation organiques du vivant à travers les siècles, et on les a remplacés-à la manière de la production technique- par une fabrication, produit banal de l'instant.[^15]

> What happened after the Council was something else entirely: in the place of liturgy as the fruit of development came fabricated liturgy. We abandoned the organic, living process of growth and development over centuries, and replaced it – as in a manufacturing process – with a fabrication, a banal on-the-spot product.[^5]

The _Theologische_ Version, at the top of this article, appears to come only from Father Patrick de la Rocque in 2002.[^9] 

While the Gamber Version and the _Theologische_ Version are quite similar, there are several important differences. 

In the Gamber Version, Ratzinger's subject is the liturgical reform, and said "we," as in "We abandoned...". 

In the _Theologische_ Version, Fr. de la Rocque changed the subject to the Second Vatican Council, and "they," as in "They have deserted...". 

These differences are crucial. The Gamber Version, the quotation that we know Ratzinger said, clearly suggests that Ratzinger saw himself as part of a movement that misunderstood the liturgical reforms. The _Theologische_ Version, re-worded by de la Rocque, Ratzinger is separated from the erring reformers, and speaks in much harsher language.
