The following quotation (or variations thereof) is attributed to the controversial theologian Father Edward Schillebeeckx, O.P.: 

> “We express it diplomatically [now], but after the Council we will draw the implicit conclusions.”

The citation given for the quote is almost always the same: 

> De Bazuin, No. 16, 1965

# Says who?

The quote has circulated for years now. Perhaps most famously, it was used in the book _Iota Unum_, by Romano Ameri[^1], and in Archbishop Lefebvre’s _Open Letter to Confused Catholics_[^2].

From Lefebvre: 

> Fr. Schillebeeckx admitted it. "We have used ambiguous terms during the Council and we know how we shall interpret them afterwards". Those people knew what they were doing. 

# Did he say it?

Given the complexity of this particular saga, I will jump to the conclusion. 

Schillebeeckx did not say it; he quoted someone else who said it, and he disagreed with the speaker. 

In the article, “Wij denken gepassioneerd en in cliche's” (“We speak passionately and in cliches”), published in Dutch Catholic weekly magazine De Bazuin, volume 48, number 16 (Jan. 23rd, 1965), pp. 4-6, Schillebeeckx said[^3]: 

> Een theoloog uit de leerstellige commissie aan wie ik reeds tijdens de tweede sessie klaagde over het “minimalisme” aan pauselijke collegialiteit in het nieuwe schema, zei me geruststellend: **“we zeggen het diplomatiek, maar na het concilie trekken we de geïmpliceerde conclusies”. Ik vond dit toen unfair en geloofde trouwens niet in zulk een concilieinterpretatie,** waarbij de ene categorie stemmers de pauselijke collegialiteit zou negeren en de andere categorie ze zou impliceren! Er had ofwel een duidelijke tekst moeten zijn waarin het maximalisme (wat de collegialiteit bewat treft) ondubbelzinnig werd geformuleerd, ofwel een duidelijke tekst waarin de eerder minimalistische opvatting (die het schema uitdrukkelijk formuleert) wordt ontdaan van haar dubbelzinnige vaagheid-door-verzwijging van het eigenlijke probleem.

> A theologian from the doctrinal committee to whom I already complained during the second session about the "minimalism" of papal collegiality in the new scheme, said reassuringly, **"we say it diplomatically, but after the council we draw the implied conclusions." I found this unfair at the time, and by the way, did not believe in such a council interpretation,** where one category of voters would ignore papal collegiality and the other category would imply it! There should have been either a clear text in which maximalism (which affects the collegiality) was unambiguously formulated, or a clear text in which the rather minimalist view (which the scheme expressly formulates) is stripped of its ambiguous vagueness-by-concealment of the actual problem. (Google Translate; emphasis added)

(Oddly, one website[^4] got the attribution right.)

While it would be correct to say that Schillebeeckx was aware of the tactic of manipulating ambiguous conciliar documents, he disagreed with the practice. Schillebeeckx may be justly accused of many conciliar and theological crimes, but surprisingly, not this one. 

How I found the correct citations is below, as is the full, complicated context of Schillebeeckx’ quotation. 

# Unexpected success

Adding Bazuin to my Schillebeeckx terms (ignoring volume and year terms for now) led me to a collected bibliography of Schillebeeckx’s works[^5] - a perfect find! 

I scanned the document for all references to articles in De Bazuin - of which there were a significant number. On page 44, we find the following citation: 

> Wij denken gepassioneerd en in cliché's, in: De Bazuin 48 nr. 16 (Jan. 23rd, 1965), 4-6. 

This is quite promising. Confusing volume, issue, and number information is common, so I’m not surprised that at some point the volume number got lost.

Now all I need to do is find the right De Bazuin, find out who holds it, if they hold the right issue, and if they accept requests from independent researchers. 

# Finding the right magazine

In Worldcat, there are at least a dozen “De Bazuin” journals and magazines, with varying subtitles. 

An Ecclesia Dei article[^6] says that De Bazuin was run by Dutch Dominicans from 1911-2002. A FishEaters forum post[^7] calls it the “magazine of the Dutch Ecclesial Province.” A New York Times article[^8] calls it a “progressive weekly”. The Catholic News Service called it a “Dutch Catholic weekly,”[^9] and that it was a national paper run by Dominicans.[^10]  

Distilling from the above sources and a few more newspapers, I can name at least several editors-in-chief: Fr. Nicol Versluis, Fr. Thomas Jannsens, Fr. H. van Gelder[^11], O. S. A., and curiously in 1967, Dr. J. Colijn - a Protestant. 

One of the less glamorous aspects of researching esoteric modern Catholic records is the multiplicity of records. It’s not uncommon for the same book, journal, or magazine, etc. to have multiple records in Worldcat. I also am unsure what this item might be classified as - a periodical? A magazine? A journal? If it was collected and rebound, maybe even a book? 

The only way forward is the honest one: a title search in Worldcat for Bazuin (taking no chances, no De’s), sorting alphabetically by title, and scouring each listing. What I am hoping for is any term connected to (the Dutch words for) Catholic, Dominicans, 1911-2002, or any of the editors. 

Several hours of Dutch digging netted this promising record: a De Bazuin[^12] published from 1912-2002 by Dominicans. The “Notes” section of that record is particularly helpful, if you’ll pardon the Google Translate: 

> “From about 1925 with subtitle: popular religious-scientific and apologetic weekly for the Netherlands and colonies; from 1947? with subtitle: weekly magazine for the proclamation of faith; later with subtitle: opinion weekly for church and society; then: newsmagazine for faith and society, culture and spirituality.” 

# Requesting the right issue 

Worldcat says that 16 institutions hold that De Bazuin. In a normal situation, you should request interlibrary loans through your public library (or university library - whatever your library affiliation is). My local library’s ILL services are indefinitely suspended, so I am operating as an independent researcher fully at the mercy of these institutions. 

I went through the 16 libraries that should have De Bazuin, and searched their library catalogs so that I could see the listing information (i.e. - do you have the issue I need?). This catalog record[^13] is a good example of what a serial listing looks like in a catalog record. 

Eventually, I flagged about a dozen institutions that I thought might have the right issue. Then I had the bonus task of finding their “Contact” form - no small feat these days. In my email, I asked three separate things: 1) Did their library have the correct De Bazuin, 2) Did they have the relevant issue, and 3) Did they lend items to independent researchers? 

I heard back from the majority of institutions within 12 hours - remarkable! I got a variety of answers: no, we have a different Bazuin; we have the magazine but not that issue; actually we got rid of a lot of our print holdings (and Worldcat doesn’t automatically update information like this); we have it but no one is on site; we have it but you’d need to request it through a library (more than fair); we don’t have it but here’s more information about Schillebeeckx that may help; and we don’t have it but here are a few places that may (very kind!). 

And then, the most unexpected: one library simply said ‘see attached’. There was the article in full! 

A quick skim of the article made it clear that the article was a response, or follow-up, to an earlier article by Schillebeeckx. I checked the bibliography I’d found earlier, got the citation (December 23, 1964 - about a month before the article I had), and once again fell upon the generosity of this Dutch library. They obliged immediately, and I now had 2 full-text articles to sift through. 

Some stabs in the dark with Dutch terms about “conclusions” and “implicit” got me to the quote under review. 

Skimming the two articles also sparked a number of questions. 

The tone seemed apocalyptic: Schillebeeckx spoke of something at the Council that "carries the possibility of an at least inner schism in the minds of the faithful" (December 1964: “die de mogelijkheid in zich draagt van een althans innerlijk schisma in de geesten der gelovigen,”), and that felt like the "sadness when the dead loved one's body is still in the side room” (also December: "Het is steeds moeilijk iemand in droefheid te troosten als het lijk van de dierbare afgestorvene nog in de zijkamer ligt").[^14]
