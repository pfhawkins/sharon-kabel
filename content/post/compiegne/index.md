The 16 Carmelites martyrs of Compiegne have become famous not only for their martyrdom, but for singing while at the scaffold. 

William Bush, in _To Quell the Terror: The Mystery of the Vocation of the Sixteen Carmelites of Compi√®gne Guillotined July 17, 1794_, draws from eyewitness accounts and archival material to describe what exactly the sisters sang. 

The first song to note is a parody of _La Marseillaise_, written by one of the sisters, and sung when the sisters were in prison awaiting trial. A partial translation from Bush's book is below: 

Let our hearts be giv'n to joyfulness
The day of glory now is here!
Let us banish all of our weakness,
We can see that the cross now is near!
Let's prepare ourselves for the victory!
Let us each as a conqueror go forth!
Under the cross, God's great banner,
Let's all run, let's all fly toward glory!
Let our ardor be enflamed!
Let's give our bodies in his Name!
Let's climb, let's climb, the scaffold high!
We'll give God the victory!
