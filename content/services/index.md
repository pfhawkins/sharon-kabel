# Reference and Research
In the library world, the typical distinction between these similar services is that Reference is quicker; Research is more involved. 
In practice, the line can be blurry. 
Types of reference and research projects I have been asked to do: 
* fact checks: Did St. John Chrysostom really say this quote on wifely submission?  
* literature reviews: Can you collect resources on health outcomes of solitary confinement? 
* research questions: What is the history of the celebration of Hanukkah? 

# Proofreading and Copy editing
I have experience with both from the past 8 years. 
I have experience with: 
* high school and college papers
* poetry
* resumes
* fiction books
Thesis and Dissertation Editing
This is a more advanced and specialized category than the previous one. Typically, a thesis or dissertation will have not one, but two style guides to follow: its discipline (such as Chicago or MLA) and its department (such as the institutionâ€™s Philosophy department). 

# Wedding programs
One of the services I offer via latinmasswedding.com is custom wedding programs for traditional Catholic weddings. 
My wedding program template is available free of charge; donations are welcome. Any custom editing or research will come with a fee. 
Data visualization
As a complement to some of the above services, I can generate a variety of data visualizations. 
Examples include: 
* bar charts: Papal citation sources 
* maps: weddings 
* abuse crisis visualizations
